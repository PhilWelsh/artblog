One problem that often plagues creative types is 'the block'. The dreaded times in between explosions of expression where regardless how much an artist pushes or relaxes are unable to create meaningful work. 

I personally suffer this all too much and the reasons for it can be varying.

## Choice is Agony

One particular problem that I notice myself regularly getting dragged down by is the choice paralysis! My biggest flaw in life is my indecisiveness. Should i work on some digital artwork, or some anatomy studies? I haven't done some life sketching for a while, but i've also been meaning to learn how to paint with acrylics, and there was that viral art challenge i wanted to take part in and OH and it's 10pm and i've spent 3 hours idly listening to 'the office' and staring at my thumbs.

## Don't start what you can't finish

An all too common reason for starting something is the fear of failure. I wasn't aware of how much this impacted me or how severe it can get until listening to the tale of a cleaner who helped people with hoarding problems. Many of these people started by being worried to start something they weren't sure they could finish. They weren't sure of what they could throw out or that starting to clean might be such an arduous task that they would never be able to succeed. Even in other aspects of my life i have found this creeping in, who else avoids going to the gym despite wanting to go.

## Can't start? Don't start

"If i could draw i would do it all the time", "I wish i had talent at that". If you've heard these sayings (usually from non artistic people), then you've known people with this problem. With nowhere to start, stepping into the unknown is definitely tricky and if you have zero or extremely little knowledge or connection it might seem impossible, or at least a real challenge without some guidance

## Ok fine... but when?

no time? Enough said. Some things in life are bigger, and if you don't value this enough you won't ever find time for it. That being said, that might mean this isn't something worthy of your time. Working, following hobbies, relationships or just wanting time to unwind and enjoy life are important, if you find after all that you don't have the time to work on creative improvement it might just be that it's not a priority, or at least right now.

## A little less motivation a little less action

Out of all of this list i rarely find myself feeling this. Improvement is important, and if i don't have some reason or excuse (legitimate or not) i will try to put effort into creative pursuits. Some things might kill motivation or step on your passion (including other items in this list)

## Comparison

A few years i heard the term 'bigorexia'. I thought it was a stupid word at the time, and I still do, but the effects are as real as any confidence disorder. It's a gym rat version of anorexia, where comparing to the bigger lifters makes one feel inadequate and ashamed of their bodies, and this kind of feeling can come from anywhere where you can compare yourself to those who are seemingly more advanced than you.

Just logging onto Instagram or in any FB pages where people post art you can see limitless amounts of people and work of such extreme talent that it can make you feel very inadequate. These people are brilliant and there's clearly a large number of them, "how long will it take me to get that good", "i'll never be as good as them"

## Why bother anyway?

A slightly different note to comparison bias is wondering if there is any real reason for doing what you are in the first place... Let's face it, these things don't often come easy, and there's real struggle and effort involved. It would definitely be easier to just watch some speed paints and enjoy the lovely art without all the pain.



## So there you have it.

If you finally work up the motivation to get started and you actually manage to pick what you're gonna spend your time on, in those small hours between work, eating, hot yoga and sleeping and manage to actually work out a way to start on a learning path without just wasting hours of time. Then as you're putting in those serious hours your youtube autoplay flicks to someone doing same thing a hundred times better... Why even do it?



(no, this isn't a post to dishearten potential art-lovers, this is all building up to something i promise.\
