Thought i'd start off the year, site and blogging experience by posting some skills i hope to pick up and/or improve on throughout the year.
This is kind of a resolution or a promise to myself, but of course i'm not going to hold it to myself too seriously, if i decide to do this or that throughout the course of publishing i'll pick up or drop off whatever seems right.

So let's look at some of the categories i can break these into.

New Skills - Picking up new or nearly untouched areas where i can learn new skills in things i've never done before, or new talents in that field

Art Styles - As i'm following a lot of artists who inspire me and i should learn my own voice, but I'd also like to try and emulate some of those aspects i love and maybe include them in my own art style.

Improvement - The easiest on the list. Just keep doing more of what i know. These will be in the form of art updates and probably won't have too much to talk about compared to the others, but this is also mostly what i made this blog for.
